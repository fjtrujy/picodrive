HOW TO COMPILE THE APP

First of all, and maybe the most difficult step is make work the PS2ToolChain. 
I said difficult because some times is not working in all the different Operating systems, Windows, Linux, Mac and x86 or x64

- PS2ToolChain https://github.com/ps2dev/ps2toolchain

Apart of the things installed automatically with the PS2ToolChain (https://github.com/ps2dev/ps2toolchain) you also need:

- GSKit https://github.com/ps2dev/gsKit
- PS2SDK-Ports https://github.com/ps2dev/ps2sdk-ports


Finally I have my own fork of PS2SDK. I have done a small improvement overthere that simplify the Picodrive for PS2
The Pull Request for this fork was done, time ago but it was rejected because they said that don't fit the POSIX standars.
So, in order to make the project work you need to use my own fork

- Custom PS2SDK https://github.com/fjtrujy/ps2sdk

Finally I will try to have my fork updated with the latest PS2SDK commit, anyway in the wors scenario, you can contribute doing the PR xD

Enjoy!


PS: I will try to automate the process adding maybe an script that do everything automatically. But this something that I will try to do in the future.
